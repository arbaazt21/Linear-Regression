# Linear-Regression

-Linear regression is type of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm.

-This is a very basic algorithm.

-It is the algorithm which highly used initially and even highly studied as well.

-Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between Dependent and Independent variables.

-Main target of linear regression is to find out the Best-Fit-Line (y = ax + b)

  y = mx + c  --->>  This is an equation of simple linear regression

  y = Dependent variable

  x = Independent variable

  m = Slope

  c = Intercept / is constant means the value of y when x is 0.

-Linear regression is an algorithm where we basically try to understand the linear relationship between Dependent and one or more Independent variables.
