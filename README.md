# Linear-Regression

Linear regression is type of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm.

This is a very basic algorithm.
It is the algorithm which highly used initially and even highly studied as well.

Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between Dependent and Independent variables.

Main target of linear regression is to find out the Best-Fit-Line.

Linear regression is an algorithm where we basically try to understand the linear relationship between Dependent and one or more Independent variables.
